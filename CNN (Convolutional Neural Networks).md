## CNN: Convolutional Neural Networks

### CNNs
- Regular neural nets ignore spatial structure
- CNNs understand:
  - Edges
  - Shapes
  - Textures

### Core CNN Components
- Convolution layers:
  - Learn filters (kernels)
- Pooling:
  - Downsample
  - Reduce noise
- Activation functions:
  - ReLU most common

### CNN in Medical Imaging
- X-ray: pneumonia detection
- MRI: tumor segmentation
- CT: organ detection

### 2D vs 3D CNNs
- 2D:
  - Slice-based
  - Faster
- 3D:
  - Volumetric context
  - More accurate but expensive

### Key Takeaway
CNNs learn what doctors visually recognize, but mathematically.
