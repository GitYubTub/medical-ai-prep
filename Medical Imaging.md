## Section 6: Medical Imaging

### Common Modalities
- X-ray:
  - 2D
  - Cheap, fast
- CT:
  - 3D slices
  - Density-based (Hounsfield units)
- MRI:
  - Soft tissue detail
  - Multiple sequences
- Ultrasound:
  - Real-time
  - No radiation

### Key Challenges
- Low contrast
- Noise
- Different scanners
- Small datasets
- Ethical concerns

### Why AI Is Hard Here
- Labeling requires doctors
- Class imbalance (rare diseases)
- Models must be explainable

### Key Takeaway
Medical images are data-rich but label-poor.
