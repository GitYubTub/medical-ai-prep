## Biostatistics Series Module 10: Brief Overview of Multivariate Methods
### General Multivariate analysis 
- Looks at 3 or more variables at the same time to understand their relationships.
- Split into:
  - Dependence techniques: clear dependent (outcome) and independent (predictor) variables.
  - Interdependence techniques: no outcome variable; all variables treated equally.
- Historically underused due to heavy computation, but now more accessible via software.

### Dependence techniques
- Multiple linear regression
  - Predicts a single numeric outcome from several numeric predictors.
  - Uses linear model: outcome = constant + (coefficients * predictors) + error.
  - Main uses:
    - Measure strength/effect of each predictor.
    - Estimate how outcome changes with predictors.
    - Predict trends/future values.
